# Vulnerabilities of smart contract
This is a repo that contains the smart contract vulnerabilities, such as reenrtancy and infinite loop.

## Reentrancy Risk of Ethereum Smart Contract

`Reentrancy_cross_function.sol`

An attacker may also be able to do a similar attack using two different functions that share the same state. These attacks are harder to detect. A cross-function reentrancy attack is possible when a vulnerable function shares state with another function that has a desirable effect for the attacker.

## Infinite Loop Risk of Vntchain smart Contract

`Infinite_loop_for.c`

`Infinite_loop_while.c`

`Infinite_loop_function_ring.c`

`Infinite_loop_fallback_ring.c`
